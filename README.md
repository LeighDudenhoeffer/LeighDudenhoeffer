- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeighDudenhoeffer
- 👀 I’m in a sponsored cybersecurity education program based on my abilities, education, and prior employment in the IT field.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you think I can handle and whatever you think I CANNOT handle. When you challenge people, you enable them to better themselves, and you give them more tools for earning a job.
- 📫 How to reach me: the usual way. (If you can't figure it out, go to my web page and email me from there!!)
