- 👋 Hi, I’m Leigh Dudenhoeffer
- 👀 I’m in an IBM sponsored cybersecurity education program based on my abilities, education, and prior employment in the IT field.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you think I can handle and whatever you think I CAN'T handle. When people are challenged with new things, their enabled to better themselves, and this provides them with more tools to earn a job.
- 📫 How to reach me: the usual way. (If you can't figure it out, go to my web page and email me from there!!)
